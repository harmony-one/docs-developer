Trust Wallet is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet. Please visit [https://trustwallet.com](https://trustwallet.com) with your mobile device to download the app.

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

Please note that Trust Wallet does not support sharded network architecture yet, and **all transactions originated from Trust Wallet goes through shard 0**. This means that you can only view and access your funds in shard 0. 

### Incoming transactions

The funds that are sent within Shard-0 will be viewed correctly in Trust Wallet. 

If you receive funds in a shard other than Shard-0 \(i.e. In shard 2, you will not see the transaction receipt in Trust Wallet app.\) Since your account balance will only show the funds in shard 0, your total balance will not change. 

### Outgoing transactions

Since there is no shard selection in Trust Wallet UI, all transactions will originate from shard 0 and will be sent to shard 0.

## **For more details, please see example cross-shard transaction scenarios using Trust Wallet:**
