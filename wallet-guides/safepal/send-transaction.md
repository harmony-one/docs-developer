## Receiving ONE in SafePal

To receive ONE tokens on your SafePal device, scan the QR code on the device using your phone ...

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the SafePal S1 hardware wallet won't show the balance since the SafePal S1 hardware wallet is completely offline, it cannot detect any changes to your balance or list of tokens when you receive money or add/delete tokens in the SafePal App. Only after you send some money from the newly added coin and sign the transaction with the S1 hardware wallet, will S1 hardware wallet ‘knows’ there are new coins added and will display it on the screen.
{% endhint %}

Based on this mechanism, there won’t be any balance shown on the SafePal S1 wallet, because it won’t be a reliable number, especially when somebody sends you some money.
